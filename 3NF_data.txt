"Data normalized to 3NF " 

Conclusion for 3NF: Upon reviewing each table, we have determined that:

1) None of the tables include transitive dependencies.
2) Since each non-primary key characteristic depends directly on the table's main key, all tables are already in 3NF.
3) At this stage, the table structures don't require any modifications. Every table from 2NF complies with 3NF's regulations.
4) Transitive dependencies, or the inability of non-key attributes to depend on other non-key attributes, are prohibited in the transitive dependency rule (3NF), which requires a table to be       in 2NF. 

Within the current framework:

10 Every characteristic is directly reliant on the primary keys found in each table.
2) When one non-primary key property indirectly depends on the primary key, there are no infractions.
3) Because we successfully divided the data in 2NF (by eliminating partial dependencies), the data is already in a state where additional modifications are not required for 3NF.
